 {A real masterpiece. Starting from a game-like position, both sides must play accurately but White has the last laugh as he forces either perpetual check or a pin-stalemate. There is an attractive thematic try in which White makes the mistake of winning the h4-pawn, which destroys the final stalemate.

 {Despite the limited material, a very complex study - in fact, I was unable to solve it. When I saw the solution, I didn't believe that the study could be correct. After considerable manual analysis I concluded that it is sound (thanks to Marc Bourzutschky, this was later confirmed by using a database). It's really a remarkable position and a contribution to endagme theory. The study is based on a set of reciprocal zugzwangs (in all cases the pawns are on their current squares): Z1: Kc3 v Kc5, Bd1. It is obvious that this is a draw with Black to play, as if he moves his bishop White plays b4+ followed by a4. With White to play it is not so clear after 1 b4+, but Black wins by outflanking; for example, 1...Kd5 2 Kd2 Ba4 3 Kd3 Ke5 4 Ke3 Bb3 5 Kd3 Kf4 6 Kd4 Kf3 7 Kc3 Ba4 8 Kd3 Kf2 9 Kd2 Kf1 and now his king penetrates towards the white pawns. Z2: Kc3 v Ka5, Bd1. With White to play 1 Kb2 Kb6 2 Kc3 Kc5 is Z1. Black to play has nothing better than 1...Bh5, but after 2 Kd2 it's a draw. As soon as Black moves his king away from a5 White plays b4 and then a4. As we can see, occupation of d1 by Black's bishop is an important factor. Z3: Kd4 v Ka5, Be2. White to play can only continue 1 Kc3, but after 1...Bd1 we have Z2. If Black to play continues 1...Bh5, say, then 2 Kd3 (not 2 Kc3? Bd1) 2...Bd1 (or else Kd2 prevents ...Bd1) 3 Kc3 is Z2 with Black to play. If 1...Bf1, then 2 Kc3 and 3 Kc2 (or d2). Now it is possible to understand the solution.} 1. Kc7 $1 ({Not} 1. Kd7 $2 Kb7 2.

 {Another judge might well have rated this study lower, but I feel it has several merits. The play soon leads to a position in which one might well resign in an over-the-board game, but White pulls off a remarkable save based on a mid-board stalemate. The position is natural and there are no complicated sidelines (in fact, no sidelines at all!) to distract from the main point of the study. The only real defects are the perfunctory introductory play and the fact that Black's h5-rook doesn't move during the solution. I would also have preferred to have Black to play in the initial position rather than White's king in check. A somewhat similar idea has been shown by this composer (#20388) but the current setting is considerably superior to the earlier one in that the pieces move into place in a more natural way and White's king performs a switchback.} 1.

 {The finale is undoubtedly spectacular, but it is very similar to a study by Kubbel (#59944). That study is much shorter and contains less play, but while the play is more interesting here, it is a significant minus that Black starts off with 2 queens in the diagram. Also, from the solver's perspective, it is unfortunate that the solution depends so heavily on database positions of Q+P v Q which to many solvers will not be obvious wins.

 {This is a very complex study, involving an underpromotion by Black and reciprocal zugzwangs. White's queen finally defeats Black's collection of minor pieces thanks to Black's poor king position.

 {In einer (lцsbaren) Remisstudie (mit WeiЯ am Zug) ist ein schwarzer Lдufer vom Brett gefallen, und es entstand die im Diagramm gezeigte Remisstudie von Kusmitschow. Wo stand der fehlende Lдufer? Wie viele Lцsungen?} 1. Re2+ $1 Ka3 (1... Ka1 2. Ra2+ Kxa2) 2. Ra2+ $1 Kb4 (2... Kb3 3. Ra3+ Kxa3) (2... Kxa2) 3. Rb2+ $1 Kc4 (3... Kc3 4. Rb3+ Kxb3) 4. Rc2+ $1 Kd4 5. Rd2 {1. Not looking at trivial cases we can exclude all black squares because after n. ... Ke* n+1. Re2 the black squared bishop pins the rook moving to the e3-h6 diagonal.  2. A white squared bishop would disturb the initial stalmate play either allowing to cover the black king along the diagonals a8-h1, a6-c8, a4-e8, b3-g8 or creating a mate on c2 along the a4-e1 and b1-h7 diagonals. So we find five squares for the black bishop: e2, f1, h5, g4, h3.  3. This all is not very exciting if we had not a paradigm shift: A black bishop on b5 or c4 obstructs the a6 square and allows the 1. Ra6+ starting move in the stalemate combination.} 1/2-1/2
